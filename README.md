# TFCLang
An open source programming language, which can be modified by the user to fit their needs.

If you want something added, and you know java, feel free to add it to the source code.

When I get the class loader itself working, I will definitely be adding my custom builtin functions using my own programming language.

Just make a pull request, I'll read through it, and if I think it's good, I'll add it.

I should probably also say that you should not rely too heavily on the custom java classes of this. They will most likely change a lot.

I will probably eventually make a builtin TClass for handling interactions with the java part of this language.
