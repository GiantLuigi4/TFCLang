An open source programming language, which can be modified by the user to fit their needs.

If you want something added, and you know java, feel free to add it to the source code.
When I get the class loader itself working, I will definitely be adding my custom builtin functions using my own programming language.
Just make a pull request, I'll read through it, and if I think it's good, I'll add it.
